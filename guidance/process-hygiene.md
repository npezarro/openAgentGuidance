# Process Hygiene

Track what you start. Clean up what you leave behind.

## Track What You Start

If you spawn a long-running process (`npm run dev`, a background build, a watch command, a test runner in watch mode), you own it for the duration of your session.

- **Record the PID or process name** when you start something. You'll need it to stop it later.
- **Stop it before session end** or document it in `context.md` so the next session knows it's running.
- **Don't assume your process manager will manage it.** Only processes declared in the process manager's config (e.g. `ecosystem.config.cjs`) are managed. Anything you start with `node`, `npm run dev`, or `&` is orphaned when your session ends.

```bash
# Start a dev server: note the PID
npm run dev &
DEV_PID=$!
echo "Dev server running on PID $DEV_PID"

# Later, clean up
kill $DEV_PID
```

## Atomic State Writes

When updating `context.md` or `progress.md`, treat the update as its own operation; don't leave it as the last step in a chain that might not complete.

- **Update context files early and often**, not just at session end
- **Commit the context update with the work it describes**, in the same commit
- If you're about to do something risky (a build, a deploy, a large refactor), update `context.md` *before* the risky step so that if it crashes, the state is captured

## Temp File Cleanup

- Don't leave temp files in `/tmp`, project directories, or anywhere else
- If you create scratch files during debugging (`test.js`, `debug.log`, `temp.json`), delete them before committing
- If a process creates temp files (detached job output, build artifacts), clean them up or document their location

## Port and Process Conflicts

Before starting any server or service:

```bash
# Is the port already in use?
ss -tlnp | grep <port>

# Is a previous instance still running?
ps aux | grep <process-name>
pm2 list
```

Don't blindly start a service on a port that's occupied. Either stop the existing process (if it's yours) or use a different port. If the existing process belongs to another session, coordinate; don't kill it.

### PM2 Restart EADDRINUSE Crash Loop

When PM2 restarts a process, the old Node instance may not release its port before the new one starts, causing `EADDRINUSE` -> crash -> PM2 restart -> repeat.

**Three-layer fix:**

1. **`kill_timeout` and `listen_timeout` in ecosystem.config:**
   ```js
   { kill_timeout: 3000, listen_timeout: 3000 }
   ```
2. **Graceful shutdown handler in server code**: handle both SIGINT and SIGTERM, close DB connections inside `server.close()` callback, add a force-exit fallback, and register global error handlers:
   ```js
   function shutdown() {
     server.close(() => {
       // Close DB BEFORE process.exit(): flushes WAL, releases locks
       if (db && typeof db.close === 'function') db.close();
       process.exit(0);
     });
     // Force exit if graceful shutdown takes too long
     setTimeout(() => process.exit(1), 5000);
   }
   process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
   process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason) => console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason));
   process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => { console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err); setTimeout(() => process.exit(1), 100); });
   ```
   - SIGINT handles Ctrl-C in dev, SIGTERM handles PM2 restart. Both are needed.
   - Close DB (and any other resource) inside `server.close()` callback, not after it; ensures SQLite WAL is flushed and connections released before the process exits, preventing SQLITE_BUSY or "database is locked" on the next PM2 start.
   - The force-exit prevents PM2 from hanging on keep-alive connections that never drain.
   - `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` log before exiting; without these, PM2 sees a silent crash with no diagnostic output.
3. **Use a `start.sh` wrapper for Next.js standalone**: `next start` as the PM2 script loses process tracking. A wrapper lets PM2 signal the actual node process:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   set -a
   if [ -f "$(dirname "$0")/.env" ]; then source "$(dirname "$0")/.env"; fi
   set +a
   # Check for both server.js AND static assets: server.js can exist from a partial build
   if [ ! -f "$(dirname "$0")/.next/standalone/server.js" ] || [ ! -d "$(dirname "$0")/.next/standalone/.next/static" ]; then
     npm run build
   fi
   exec node "$(dirname "$0")/.next/standalone/server.js"
   ```
   - Build script must use `mkdir -p .next/standalone/.next` before `rm -rf .next/standalone/.next/static`; on a fresh clone the directory doesn't exist and `cp` will fail silently. Correct form: `next build && mkdir -p .next/standalone/.next && rm -rf .next/standalone/.next/static && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/static`

**Diagnosis:** `pm2 show <process>` with rapidly increasing restart count + `EADDRINUSE` in logs = this pattern.

**Belt-and-suspenders: proactive port cleanup in start.sh.** When `kill_timeout` alone isn't enough (e.g. a previous process crashed without releasing the socket), add a `kill_port()` function at the top of `start.sh` that clears the port before launching:

```bash
kill_port() {
  local sig=$1
  if command -v fuser >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    fuser -k -$sig "${PORT}/tcp" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  elif command -v lsof >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    lsof -ti :"${PORT}" | xargs kill -$sig >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  fi
}

kill_port TERM
# Wait up to 50s for port to be free; escalate to SIGKILL at attempt 5
for i in {1..5}; do
  ss -tulpn 2>/dev/null | grep -q ":${PORT} " || break
  [ $i -eq 5 ] && kill_port 9
  sleep 10
done
```

Start with SIGTERM (graceful), escalate to SIGKILL only after several retries. Use `fuser` when available (util-linux); fall back to `lsof` (macOS / minimal Linux). This is a start.sh-level fix, not a replacement for ecosystem.config `kill_timeout`.

**App-level retry loop in `server.listen()`.** When the above layers still aren't enough (e.g. the OS hasn't released the socket despite kill_timeout + proactive kill), wrap `app.listen()` in a retry loop instead of exiting immediately:

```js
function startServer(retries = 5) {
  const srv = app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`);
    if (process.send) process.send('ready');
  });
  srv.on('error', (err) => {
    if (err.code === 'EADDRINUSE' && retries > 0) {
      console.warn(`Port ${PORT} in use, retrying in 2s... (${retries} left)`);
      setTimeout(() => { srv.close(); startServer(retries - 1); }, 2000);
    } else {
      console.error('Server error:', err);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  });
  return srv;
}
const server = startServer();
```

- Only retry on `EADDRINUSE`; hard-exit on all other errors.
- 2s delay gives the OS time to release the port between attempts.
- This layer is still needed even with `kill_timeout`, graceful shutdown, and proactive port kill all in place; EADDRINUSE can still occur intermittently.

**Client-side companion: also retry `ECONNREFUSED`.** A worker or client process that starts before its server is fully bound will receive `ECONNREFUSED` instead of `EADDRINUSE`. Include `ECONNREFUSED` in the retryable error set alongside network errors (`EAI_AGAIN`, `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`). This handles the startup-race case where the server and client launch concurrently (e.g. a process manager starts both in rapid succession).

### PM2 `cron_restart` Does Not Reliably Fire for Batch Jobs

PM2's `cron_restart` + `autorestart: false` only restarts a process that PM2 still considers "stopped" from *its own* tracking; it does not reliably reawaken a batch script that exits normally after doing its work. The script exits, PM2 marks it "stopped", and the cron silently never fires again on some deployments. A batch poster went offline for 12+ days this way, with no error and no alert; it just stopped running.

**Fix:** For any run-once/batch/cron-style PM2 process (digest posters, scrapers, daily scripts), use system crontab calling `pm2 restart <name> --update-env` as the primary scheduler. Keep `cron_restart` in `ecosystem.config.js` only as documentation, not as the sole mechanism.

## Docker Bind Mount Refresh

**`docker compose restart` does NOT refresh bind mounts.** When a container is restarted with `docker compose restart`, the container process is restarted but the container itself is not recreated. Bind mount inodes remain stale, so any files updated on the host (e.g. credential files, OAuth tokens) are not visible inside the container until the container is recreated.

**Fix:** Use `docker compose down && docker compose up -d` instead of `docker compose restart` for any operation that requires the container to pick up updated host files:

```bash
# WRONG: container process restarts but bind mount stays stale
docker compose restart

# CORRECT: container is fully recreated, bind mounts are fresh
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

**When this matters most:**
- Auth refresh cron jobs that regenerate credential files on the host and expect the container to use them
- Any post-rotate token handoff from host to containerized service

**Diagnosis:** If a cron-based recovery script keeps looping (restarting the container repeatedly without recovering), but the credential file on the host is valid, this is the likely cause. The container is holding a stale mount.

## Docker `exec` Always Needs `--user`

When running `docker exec` against a container that has a non-root application user (e.g. a `node` user), **always pass `--user <username>`** on every exec call. Without it, `docker exec` runs as root: files written inside the container (credentials, config) land in `/root/` instead of `/home/<user>/`, and the application process (running as `node`) cannot read them.

```bash
# WRONG: exec runs as root, credentials written to /root/.claude/
docker exec "$CONTAINER" sh -c 'echo data > /home/node/.claude/credentials.json'

# CORRECT: exec runs as node, credentials land where the app reads them
docker exec --user node "$CONTAINER" sh -c 'echo data > /home/node/.claude/credentials.json'
```

**Why silent:** The exec command succeeds (exit 0), the file is written, but the application process reads a different path. Auth stays broken with no obvious error.

**When this applies:** Any `docker exec` that writes or reads user-owned files (credential rotation, config injection, CLI auth refresh). A `CONTAINER_USER` env var pattern (default `"node"`) makes this portable across containers. Slim images often don't have `procps`; swap `pkill` for `ps | awk | kill`.

### PM2 Lifecycle Traps

Four PM2 behaviors that each caused a real silent failure; check all four when a PM2 service misbehaves around restarts or monitoring:

1. **Ecosystem config fields only register at process CREATION.** `pm2 restart` (even with the config file as argument) does not apply changed fields like `kill_timeout`, `treekill`, `shutdown_with_message`, log paths. To apply them: `pm2 delete <app> && pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --only <app> && pm2 save`. Verify what PM2 actually has registered with `pm2 jlist` (`pm2_env` keys), not what the ecosystem file says.

2. **`kill_signal` is not a PM2 option.** PM2 sends SIGINT on stop/restart/delete (the global `PM2_KILL_SIGNAL` daemon env is the only override). A `kill_signal: 'SIGTERM'` key in ecosystem.config is silently ignored; design your shutdown handler around SIGINT or use `shutdown_with_message`.

3. **`shutdown_with_message: true` replaces the signal entirely.** PM2 sends the IPC string message `'shutdown'` and NO signal, then SIGKILLs after `kill_timeout`. If the app doesn't have a `process.on('message', m => m === 'shutdown' && ...)` listener, EVERY restart is a full `kill_timeout` hang ending in SIGKILL, with zero log evidence, because no signal handler ever fires. Ship the ecosystem flag and the listener in the same commit; verify with `time pm2 restart <app>` (graceful = ~1-2s, hang = exactly kill_timeout).

4. **One zombie process entry poisons monitoring for the whole fleet.** A process stuck `online` with `pid: null` (process died outside PM2's view) makes PM2's pidusage batch call throw `TypeError: One of the pids provided is invalid` (~2 lines every few seconds in `~/.pm2/pm2.log`), which zeroes `monit.memory`/`cpu` for ALL apps, and silently disables every `max_memory_restart`. Diagnosis: `pm2 jlist` and look for `status: online` with no live pid. Fix: stop/delete the zombie, `pm2 save`. One such entry ran undetected for 44 days.

Also: after customizing `out_file`/`error_file`, the default `~/.pm2/logs/<app>-*.log` files stop updating but stay on disk; months later they read as plausible "current" logs and mislead debugging. Delete them when you move log paths, and check mtimes before trusting any log's content.

## Long Text Transfer

Never give the user long commands, URLs, or multi-line text to copy-paste manually. Many SSH clients mangle long pastes (newline parsing, line wrapping).

**Instead:**
- **Long commands (>~80 chars):** Write to a temp script file (e.g. `/tmp/run-me.sh`), then give a short `scp` + `bash` command
- **Long URLs:** Write to a file and `scp`, or use a short redirect
- **Multi-step commands:** Break into individual short lines, never chain with `&&` for paste
- **Short commands (<80 chars):** Direct paste is fine

**Why:** Mangled pastes cause failed commands that look like real errors. Writing to files and transferring is always reliable.

## Stale Git Lock Files

When automated processes (hooks, cron jobs, process-manager services) get killed mid-git-operation (by hook timeout, OOM, SIGTERM), they leave `.git/index.lock` files that silently block all subsequent git operations in that repo. No error is surfaced to the caller; git commands simply fail.

**Real-world impact:** A hook timeout left a lock file that blocked a usage-sync job for an entire month. The user-facing command reported "no data" with no indication that a stale lock was the cause.

**Prevention:** Any automated script that runs git commands should check for and remove stale lock files before operating:

```bash
# Remove lock files older than 60 seconds (safe threshold)
LOCK_FILE="$REPO_PATH/.git/index.lock"
if [ -f "$LOCK_FILE" ]; then
  LOCK_AGE=$(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$LOCK_FILE") ))
  if [ "$LOCK_AGE" -gt 60 ]; then
    rm -f "$LOCK_FILE"
    echo "Removed stale git lock (age: ${LOCK_AGE}s)"
  fi
fi
```

**Why 60 seconds?** Normal git operations complete in under a second. A lock older than 60 seconds is almost certainly stale. Don't remove younger locks; they may belong to an active operation.

**Where this applies:** Any cron-triggered or process-manager-managed process that does `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`.

## Stale Branch Dedup Lists

Automated agents that gate new work on a dedup list built from `git log` or `git branch -r` can block or act on stale data. If a branch's PR merged but the branch wasn't deleted, it still shows as open in `git branch -r`. The local git log window can also miss merges from before its lookback horizon.

**Pattern:** Before acting on any branch in a dedup-gated list, reconcile against actual PR state:

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch-name> --state all --json state --jq '.[0].state'
# Returns "MERGED", "CLOSED", or "OPEN"
```

Any branch returning "MERGED" or "CLOSED" is safe to delete and exclude from the dedup gate.

**Where this applies:** Any automated session that uses branch listings or git-log-based merge checks to decide whether to create PRs or skip work.

## Bash `set -u` with Optional Parameters

When scripts use `set -u` (nounset), referencing an unset positional parameter like `$2` causes an immediate exit. This breaks scripts where positional args are optional.

**Fix:** Use `${N:-}` (empty default) or `${N:-default}` for any positional parameter that may not be passed:

```bash
# WRONG: exits if $2 is not provided under set -u
if [[ "$2" == "--bg" ]]; then

# RIGHT: defaults to empty string
if [[ "${2:-}" == "--bg" ]]; then
```

Applies to any script using `set -euo pipefail` with optional args.

## Bash `${VAR:-default}` vs `${VAR-default}`: Empty Counts as Unset

`${VAR:-default}` substitutes the default if `VAR` is **unset OR empty**. `${VAR-default}` substitutes only if `VAR` is **unset**. When a script intentionally sets a var to empty string to disable optional behavior, using `:-` silently ignores that intent.

```bash
export TARGETS=""         # caller wants to skip the restart step

# WRONG: empty string treated as unset, defaults to "a b c"
TARGETS="${TARGETS:-a b c}"

# CORRECT: only substitutes when TARGETS is genuinely unset
TARGETS="${TARGETS-a b c}"
```

**When this matters:** Any script with optional feature flags passed as environment variables. If `FOO=""` should mean "disabled", use `${FOO-default}`. If `FOO=""` should mean "use default", use `${FOO:-default}`.

## Python `smtplib`: Validate Email Addresses Before Sending

Always guard `smtplib` send calls with a basic address sanity check. If `to_email` is empty, `None`, a placeholder (e.g. a username without a domain), or pulled from a config field that may not be set, passing it directly to `smtplib.SMTP` raises `smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused` or triggers an SMTP error that surfaces as an unhandled exception in the pipeline.

```python
def send_completion_email(to_email: str, subject: str, body: str) -> None:
    if not to_email or "@" not in to_email:
        log.warning(f"Skipping email: invalid address: {to_email!r}")
        return

    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        # ... rest of send
```

**Why:** Pipeline config fields that accept an email address may be left blank or filled with a display name instead of an address. The SMTP server will reject the recipient, throwing an exception that fails the whole job. A cheap guard at the function boundary prevents this.

## `pm2 restart <name>` Does NOT Pick Up Ecosystem Config Changes

`pm2 restart <name>` restarts the process using its **in-memory config**, ignoring any changes you've made to `ecosystem.config.js`. Changes to `node_args`, `max_memory_restart`, env vars, and other config fields are silently ignored.

To apply config changes:

```bash
# BAD: restarts the process but ignores ecosystem.config.js changes
pm2 restart my-app

# GOOD: re-reads ecosystem.config.js and applies all config changes
pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.config.js
```

**When this matters:**
- You changed `node_args` to add `--max-old-space-size` (or any V8 flag)
- You raised/lowered `max_memory_restart`
- You added/changed env vars in the ecosystem config
- You changed `watch` paths, `listen_timeout`, or `kill_timeout`

Always run `pm2 save` after `pm2 startOrRestart` to persist the updated config for `systemd resurrect`.

## PM2 Crash Loops from DB Dependency on Startup

Services that connect to Postgres (or any external DB) at module load time can enter a tight PM2 restart loop if the DB isn't ready on first boot or after a host reboot. Two-layer fix:

**Layer 1: PM2 exponential backoff:** Add `exp_backoff_restart_delay: 100` to the ecosystem config. PM2 doubles the restart delay on each consecutive failure (100ms -> 200ms -> 400ms) instead of hammering the process in a tight loop.

```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "my-app",
    max_restarts: 10,
    autorestart: true,
    exp_backoff_restart_delay: 100,
  }],
};
```

**Layer 2: Application-level connection retry:** For Prisma, add startup retry in `src/lib/db.ts` so the process doesn't crash before the DB becomes available:

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  const connectWithRetry = async (retries = 5, delay = 2000) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
      try {
        await prisma.$connect();
        return;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`[db] Prisma connect failed (${i + 1}/${retries}):`, (err as Error).message);
        if (i < retries - 1) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
      }
    }
    console.error("[db] All Prisma connection attempts failed.");
  };
  connectWithRetry();
}
```

**When to apply:** Any Next.js + Prisma service on PM2. Especially important after host reboots; Postgres may take a few seconds to accept connections, causing the first startup attempt to fail. The two layers are complementary: app-level retry handles transient blips; PM2 backoff prevents hammering when the DB is down for longer.

## Bash `date +%H` Produces Octal-Invalid Strings in Arithmetic

`date +%H` emits zero-padded hours (`08`, `09`). Bash `(( ))` arithmetic interprets numbers starting with `0` as octal; `08` and `09` are invalid octal, causing arithmetic to fail with `value too great for base` at those hours only.

```bash
# BAD: fails silently (or aborts with set -e) at hours 08 and 09
current_hour=$(date +%H)          # "08"
(( current_hour >= 8 )) && ...    # bash: 08: value too great for base

# GOOD: no zero-pad (GNU date)
current_hour=$(date +%-H)         # "8"
(( current_hour >= 8 )) && ...    # works

# macOS alternative: printf forces decimal interpretation
current_hour=$(printf '%d' $(date +%H))
```

This is especially insidious because it only fails at hours `08` and `09`; cron scripts appear to work on all other hours, making the bug hard to reproduce.

## `WebFetch` Routes Through the Model Provider's Edge, Not the Agent's Local Network

The agent's `WebFetch` tool sends requests through a server-side edge fetcher; it does **NOT** use the agent's local network namespace. Fetches to `localhost`, `host.docker.internal`, RFC 1918 addresses, or SSH-tunneled services fail silently: the remote fetcher resolves the hostname against the public internet, gets nothing, and returns empty or wrong output. The agent has no signal that the fetch went to the wrong place.

**Affected URLs:**
- `http://localhost:N/...`
- `http://host.docker.internal:N/...`
- `http://192.168.x.x:N/...`, `http://10.x.x.x:N/...`
- Any URL that only resolves on the agent's local network

**Fix:** Use `Bash: curl ...` instead for private/local URLs. Add `curl:*` to `--allowedTools` (or project `settings.json` permissions). Ensure `curl` is installed in any Docker image that needs it (node slim images exclude it).

**Never design system-prompt fallbacks that call `WebFetch http://host.docker.internal:...`**; the fallback silently does nothing, and there's no error to surface the failure.

## Generated Crontab Reconciliation

When a host's crontab is GENERATED from a registry file by an install script, and `--install` refuses because the live crontab has entries the registry doesn't know about, that refusal is protecting you. Never reach for `--install --force`, which silently DELETES every live-but-unregistered job (including load-bearing ones added by hand).

Procedure:
1. Diff both directions: `diff <(crontab -l | grep -vE '^\s*(#|$)' | sort) <(./generate-crontab.sh | grep -vE '^\s*(#|$)' | sort)`.
2. For each drifted job, find the documented intent before deciding direction. Drift is bidirectional: live-added jobs (new infra) AND deliberately-paused jobs (`#PAUSED-*` comments) both accumulate; the live crontab usually reflects the newest decisions.
3. Import live-only jobs into the registry as `enabled: true`; mark deliberately-paused registry jobs `enabled: false` with a `note` saying why and where that's documented.
4. `--install` (it writes a timestamped backup first), then verify the delta:
   `diff <(grep -vE '^\s*(#|$)' backups/<latest>) <(crontab -l | grep -vE '^\s*(#|$)')`
   must show exactly the changes you intended; nothing else activated or dropped.
5. When pausing or adding a job in future, do it in the registry, not the crontab; hand-edits are the source of this drift.

## Bash `set -e` Kills Error Handlers Before They Fire

When using `set -e` (errexit), a failing command causes the script to exit **immediately** before the next line executes. This makes bare `$?` capture after a command dead code; the error handler that reads `$?` never runs.

```bash
# WRONG: set -e exits after 'some_command' fails; EXIT_CODE=$? never executes
set -e
some_command
EXIT_CODE=$?
if [ "$EXIT_CODE" -ne 0 ]; then
  notify "Failed: $EXIT_CODE"   # unreachable
fi

# RIGHT: || captures exit code inline without triggering set -e
EXIT_CODE=0
some_command || EXIT_CODE=$?
if [ "$EXIT_CODE" -ne 0 ]; then
  notify "Failed: $EXIT_CODE"   # now reachable
fi
```

**Why:** Multiple runner scripts had this bug: timeout logs, alerts, and state-file writes were all dead code because `set -e` aborted before the inline `EXIT_CODE=$?` capture. All failure notifications silently never fired for months.

**How to apply:** In any `set -e` or `set -euo pipefail` script, capture exit codes inline with `cmd || VAR=$?`. Never write `cmd; VAR=$?`; the semicolon is still `set -e`-transparent and exits on failure.

## Bash `git stash pop` Must Be Guarded

Never call `git stash pop` unconditionally in a script. If the script stashed nothing (because the working tree was clean), an unconditional pop will dump a **pre-existing user stash** onto whatever branch is checked out, potentially overwriting unrelated in-progress work.

```bash
# WRONG: pops whatever is on the stash stack, even if this script didn't push it
git stash
# ... do work ...
git stash pop   # might dump user's saved state onto wrong branch

# RIGHT: track whether THIS script stashed, only pop what we pushed
STASHED=false
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  git stash --quiet && STASHED=true
fi
trap '[ "$STASHED" = true ] && git stash pop --quiet 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
```

**Why:** A verify script had an unconditional `git stash pop` in its `trap cleanup EXIT`. Any user with staged work could have it silently overwritten when the verify script ran.

## PM2 Periodic-Exit Scripts Must Use `autorestart: false` with `cron_restart`

When a PM2 process is a **script** (runs, does work, then exits with code 0), PM2's default `autorestart: true` immediately re-fires it after every clean exit. Combined with `cron_restart`, this creates a restart loop: the cron fires, the script runs, exits 0, PM2 immediately re-fires it again, bypassing the cron schedule entirely.

**Rule:** For any PM2 process that exits on completion (data push scripts, sync jobs, batch processors), always pair `cron_restart` with `autorestart: false`:

```js
// BAD: script exits 0 after each push; PM2 re-fires immediately, ignoring cron
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "dashboard-push",
    script: "scripts/push-metrics.sh",
    cron_restart: "*/5 * * * *",
    // autorestart defaults to true → restart loop
  }]
};

// GOOD: autorestart: false lets cron_restart be the only trigger
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "dashboard-push",
    script: "scripts/push-metrics.sh",
    cron_restart: "*/5 * * * *",
    autorestart: false,  // process stays in "waiting restart" until cron fires
  }]
};
```

**Contrast with long-running services:** Always-on servers (Next.js, Express, supervisors) should keep `autorestart: true` (the default) so PM2 recovers from crashes. The `autorestart: false` pattern is only for scripts that exit normally after each run.

Also check: PM2 health allowlists, since `autorestart: false` processes appear in `waiting restart` state between cron fires.

## Cron Wrappers on Remote Machines: Self-Sync via `git pull --ff-only`

Cron scripts running on isolated machines (a second PC, a Raspberry Pi, or any host without an automatic deploy pipeline) should `git pull --ff-only` at the start of each run. Without this, code/config fixes pushed to the remote don't reach the machine until someone manually SSHs in, meaning a fix shipped during the day won't make the overnight scheduled run.

```bash
# At the top of the cron wrapper, before activating venv / installing deps
cd "$REPO"
echo "--- git pull ---"
git pull --ff-only 2>&1 | grep -v "^Already up to date" || true
```

- `--ff-only` prevents the pull from attempting a merge if the local branch has diverged. On diverge, the pull prints a warning but doesn't fail the run (due to `|| true`).
- `grep -v "Already up to date"` keeps the log clean on no-op pulls.
- Place this BEFORE `source .venv/bin/activate` or `npm install` so updated dependency specs are also picked up.

**Machines this applies to:** any host that runs scheduled jobs but doesn't receive automatic deploys (git hooks, process-manager reload, CI/CD). Hosts with deploy pipelines don't need this; isolated machines do.

## `claude -p` vs `claude --print`: Positional Argument Trap

`-p` is NOT a clean alias for `--print`. The `-p` flag treats the **next CLI argument as a positional prompt string**, which means any flag that follows it gets consumed as prompt text instead.

```bash
# WRONG: '--model sonnet' is consumed as the prompt; stdin is ignored
echo "my prompt" | claude -p --model sonnet

# CORRECT: use --print (long form) when combining with other flags
echo "my prompt" | claude --print --model sonnet
```

**Why it matters for automation:** Piped-stdin scripts that use `claude -p --model X` silently produce wrong output; the model flag becomes the prompt and the model defaults to whatever the CLI picks. No error, no warning.

**Rule:** In any script or cron job that pipes stdin to `claude`, use `--print` (not `-p`) whenever other flags follow. Reserve `-p` for single-argument invocations like `claude -p "inline prompt"` (no piped stdin).

### Retrying Transient ConnectionError / Timeout on External APIs (Python)

Some environments (notably WSL2) suffer intermittent DNS blips, especially during overnight cron windows, causing `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` (`NameResolutionError`) on calls to external APIs. One blip drops the entire poll cycle and generates noisy ERROR logs.

**Correct pattern**: wrap the call in a manual retry loop:

```python
def _api_get(url, params=None, _retries=2):
    for attempt in range(_retries + 1):
        try:
            resp = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=15)
            resp.raise_for_status()
            return resp.json()
        except (requests.exceptions.ConnectionError, requests.exceptions.Timeout) as e:
            if attempt < _retries:
                logger.debug(f"Request failed (attempt {attempt+1}/{_retries+1}), retrying in 5s: {e}")
                time.sleep(5)
            else:
                raise
```

**Why not `urllib3.Retry`?** Its `retry_on_connection_error=True` parameter can crash the process on import. The manual loop is the safe cross-platform approach.

**When to apply:** any Python service polling an external API from WSL2 or a cron context. Wrap the raw `requests.get()` in a helper like `_api_get()` and route all calls through it.

### SSH Tunnel Bridge: Use 127.0.0.1 and Retry Transient Errors

When an app connects to a local service via an SSH reverse tunnel, two patterns prevent tunnel flap from causing permanent job failures:

**1. Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`**

`localhost` can resolve to `::1` (IPv6) while the tunnel listener is bound to `127.0.0.1` only, causing silent `ECONNREFUSED`. Hard-code the IPv4 loopback:

```typescript
const BRIDGE_URL = process.env.BRIDGE_URL || "http://127.0.0.1:3095";
```

**2. Retry transient connection errors (3 attempts, 5s delay)**

SSH tunnels flap briefly on reconnect. Errors that indicate the tunnel is temporarily down should be retried rather than immediately failing the job:

```typescript
function isTransientError(err: any): boolean {
  const msg = err.message || "";
  return (
    msg.includes("fetch failed") ||
    msg.includes("ECONNREFUSED") ||
    msg.includes("ECONNRESET") ||
    msg.includes("UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT") ||
    msg.includes("EHOSTUNREACH") ||
    msg.includes("socket hang up")
  );
}
// 3 attempts, 5s between retries: only for isTransientError(err)
```

Do NOT retry non-transient errors (400/401/403/503 "slots busy", 429 rate-limit); those must fail immediately.

**Applies broadly:** The `isTransientError` check is the key primitive; apply the same retry guard to any internal HTTP service call that routes through a local broker or tunnel.

### Node.js `http.request` Retry: Include DNS Errors (`ENOTFOUND`, `EAI_AGAIN`)

DNS resolution failures are transient; a temporary nameserver blip produces `ENOTFOUND` or `EAI_AGAIN`, then resolves on the next attempt. When building an `on('error')` retry handler for `http.request`, include both DNS error codes alongside the usual connection errors:

```js
req.on('error', (err) => {
  const retryable = [
    'EAI_AGAIN',     // DNS temporary failure
    'ENOTFOUND',     // DNS resolution failure (often transient)
    'ECONNRESET',    // connection dropped
    'ETIMEDOUT',     // connection timeout
    'ECONNREFUSED',  // service not yet up
  ];
  if (retries > 0 && retryable.includes(err.code)) {
    setTimeout(() => apiRequest(method, path, body, retries - 1).then(resolve).catch(reject), 2000);
  } else {
    reject(err);
  }
});
```

**Prefer loopback for co-located services:** If a worker and its API server run on the same host, hardcode `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` in the process-manager config rather than using the public hostname. This skips DNS entirely, eliminating `ENOTFOUND` as a failure mode:

```js
// worker.ecosystem.config.js
env: {
  SERVICE_URL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3010', // loopback: avoids DNS failures with public endpoint
}
```

The loopback approach and the retry guard are complementary: loopback eliminates DNS flap for same-host services; the retry guard still catches `ECONNREFUSED` when the server restarts.

## ID-Based Cursor Iteration for Large Dataset Processing

When a script processes all rows from a large DB table in batches, use **ID-based cursor pagination** instead of offset-based pagination (`LIMIT N OFFSET M`):

```typescript
let lastId = 0;
const BATCH_SIZE = 1000;

while (true) {
  const rows = await db.all(
    'SELECT * FROM entries WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id LIMIT ?',
    [lastId, BATCH_SIZE]
  );
  if (rows.length === 0) break;

  for (const row of rows) {
    await processRow(row);
  }
  lastId = rows[rows.length - 1].id;
}
```

**Why not offset pagination?** `LIMIT N OFFSET M` scans from the start on every batch (O(M) cost), accumulates memory across large offsets, and silently skips or re-processes rows when data changes between batches.

**Why ID-based works:** Each batch uses a WHERE clause on the indexed `id` column (`id > lastId`), giving O(1) lookup cost. The cursor state (`lastId`) is trivially resumable on crash/restart. No rows are skipped regardless of concurrent inserts.

**Batch sizing:** Keep batches small enough that peak per-batch memory stays under ~50-100 MB. 1000 rows/batch is a reasonable default; very wide rows (BLOBs, large text columns) need smaller batches.

### Resilient DB JSON Parsing: Wrap Every `JSON.parse()` in try/catch

When reading rows that store serialized JSON (metadata columns, config blobs, event payloads), wrap every `JSON.parse()` call in a `try/catch`. A single corrupt or malformed row should log a warning and be skipped or return a safe default; it must NOT throw uncaught and return a 500 for the entire endpoint/query.

```javascript
// Bad: one bad row crashes the entire request
const rows = await db.query('SELECT data FROM events');
return rows.map(r => JSON.parse(r.data));

// Good: corrupt row logged and skipped
return rows.flatMap(r => {
  try {
    return [JSON.parse(r.data)];
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Corrupt row skipped', { id: r.id, err: e.message });
    return [];
  }
});
```

**Why:** Production databases accumulate corrupt rows via partial writes, schema migrations, manual edits, or serialization bugs. A single bad row should never take down a live endpoint. Apply this at the DB read layer, not at the caller; callers should not need to guard against parse exceptions from internal data retrieval functions.

## Confirm Async Follow-Through, Not Just Dispatch

An agent that creates a PR, ticket, or any artifact meant to be picked up later is not done when the artifact exists; it's done when the artifact reaches its intended end state (merged, closed, actioned). "I created X" and "X was consumed" are different claims; only report the one you actually verified.

**Recurring pattern:** An autonomous runner creates one feature PR per run, but its own closeout never re-checks whether *prior* runs' PRs actually got merged. A separate janitor cron caught this independently at least five times, each time finding 1-4 fully-verified, CI-green PRs sitting stale for 2-6 days because nothing after the creating session confirmed the merge landed. One run alone found four separate repos' PRs stale simultaneously.

**Why it kept recurring:** the pattern was logged in a run log as a "Learning" three times but never promoted to a durable guidance file or a code change; each occurrence was treated as a one-off instead of a signal that the general behavior (fire-and-forget artifact creation) needed a structural fix.

**How to apply:** any runner that creates a PR/ticket/artifact for later pickup should, at the START of its next run (not just when a downstream janitor happens to notice), reconcile its own prior outputs against live state (`gh pr view <n> --json state` for every PR link in its own recent log) before creating new work. If a runner can't easily do that itself, a downstream sweep is a valid backstop, but log the sweep's cadence explicitly so staleness has a bounded worst case instead of "whenever the janitor gets to it."

## Cleanup Checklist (Before Session End)

1. **Processes:** Stop any dev servers, watch commands, or background tasks you started
2. **Temp files:** Delete any scratch files you created
3. **Ports:** Verify you haven't left a rogue server bound to a port
4. **Git state:** No uncommitted changes related to your task
5. **Context:** `context.md` reflects what's running and what's not

### Terminal paste corruption is structural: host the snippet, hand over a curl one-liner

When a snippet (heredoc, `echo >> file`, multi-line bash, anything with mixed quotes/backticks/escapes) is being pasted into a remote shell and gets mangled (smart quotes, lost newlines, "syntax error near unexpected token `newline`", "Permission denied" on `>>`), stop retrying the paste.

**Why:** terminal paste corruption is structural, not user error. Sessions burn cycles re-typing or working around broken pastes. The fix is to host the artifact and fetch it.

**How to apply:** write the content to a file served over HTTP (any static host you control), then hand the user a one-liner like `curl -sS https://<host>/<slug> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && echo OK`. Whatever hosting mechanism you use, make it refuse content matching private-key / `api_key` / password / `client_secret` patterns.

### Some CLI wrappers do not support multimodal (video/image) input

A vendor CLI's headless flag can treat `@filepath` references as **text only**. Binary attachments (mp4, jpg, png) are not passed as multimodal parts, and the model responds with "I cannot view image/video files", even though the underlying API supports native video/image input.

**Do not plan vision/video tasks around a CLI wrapper without verifying multimodal support first.** The CLI can silently fail without a clear error at the planning stage.

**Alternatives:**
- For local image understanding via an agent CLI that natively reads images through its file-read tool.
- For native video: call the provider's Files API directly (SDK or REST) with an API key.
- For text-only work: the CLI is fine.

### Chokidar file-watcher: denylist segment vs. substring matching

Chokidar's `ignored` function receives the **full file path**. Two types of denylist entries need different matching logic:

- **Single-segment entries** (e.g. `.state`, `node_modules`): match by checking if any path segment equals the entry -> `filePath.split('/').includes(d)`
- **Multi-segment entries** (e.g. `.state/tunnel-health-state.json`): match by substring presence -> `filePath.includes(d)`

Using only segment matching for all entries causes multi-segment entries to be silently skipped. If a service's own state/log files aren't excluded, the watcher creates a feedback loop: service writes state -> chokidar event fires -> service processes event -> writes more state -> repeat -> OOM.

```js
const ignored = (filePath) => {
  return denylist.some(d =>
    d.includes('/') ? filePath.includes(d) : filePath.split('/').includes(d)
  );
};
```

Also always extend the default denylist to include heavy/noisy directories (`.local`, `.rustup`, `.cache`, `node_modules`) and the service's own state/DB paths. Set `kill_timeout` high enough (>=5000ms) for chokidar to close cleanly on PM2 restart; the default 1.6s may cause EADDRINUSE loops.

### Bash `$HOSTNAME` is always set: never use `${HOSTNAME:-default}` as a bind-address guard

Bash **auto-populates `$HOSTNAME`** with the system hostname. The `${HOSTNAME:-default}` substitution **never falls back**, because `$HOSTNAME` is always non-empty.

**Why this matters for Node.js servers:** Next.js standalone, Vite preview, and several other Node servers read `process.env.HOSTNAME` to decide their bind address. If `$HOSTNAME` is the host's external hostname, the server binds to the external IP instead of loopback, and a reverse proxy's `localhost` upstream gets connection-refused (public URL returns 503 with no useful error in app logs; the server says "Ready in 0ms").

**Fix:** Force-set the bind address explicitly:
```bash
export HOSTNAME="127.0.0.1"   # GOOD: force-set, always wins
# NOT this:
export HOSTNAME=${HOSTNAME:-"0.0.0.0"}  # BAD: bash pre-fills $HOSTNAME, fallback never triggers
```

Other bash builtins similarly always populated (must not be used as `:-` defaults): `BASH_VERSION`, `PWD`, `OLDPWD`, `EUID`, `UID`, `PATH`, `SHELL`.

**Diagnostic:** If a Node service logs "listening" but the proxy (or curl from localhost) gets connection-refused, run `ss -ltnp | grep <port>` and check the bind address before assuming the proxy is broken.

### SQLite `.iterate()` Cleanup and File-Watcher Depth Limiting

**SQLite iterator cleanup:** Always wrap `.iterate()` in try/finally to ensure the cursor is closed even on error. An unclosed iterator holds a read transaction open, preventing WAL checkpoints and causing memory growth under high load:

```js
const iter = stmt.iterate(params);
try {
  for (const row of iter) { /* process */ }
} finally {
  try { iter.return(); } catch (_) {}
}
```

Also tune `PRAGMA cache_size` to cap SQLite's memory footprint (`PRAGMA cache_size = -32000` sets a 32 MB cap).

**File-watcher depth limiting:** Always set an explicit `depth` cap on chokidar watchers. The default (unbounded) can traverse large trees (home dir, deep node_modules) and OOM the process:

```js
chokidar.watch(paths, { depth: 2, usePolling: false })
```

`depth: 2` is usually sufficient for project file-watching. Combine with the denylist segment/substring pattern above to prevent feedback loops. Note when reading a depth option from config: use `?? 2`, not `|| 2`, since `0` is a valid depth.

### Background Queue Saturation Guards for Webhook Handlers

When a route handler spawns fire-and-forget background work (webhook processors, job dispatchers), track pending task count and return HTTP 503 when a cap is exceeded. Without this guard, burst traffic creates unbounded task queues that OOM the process:

```js
let pendingTasks = 0;
const MAX_PENDING_TASKS = 100;

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  if (pendingTasks >= MAX_PENDING_TASKS) {
    return res.status(503).json({ error: 'Queue full, retry later' });
  }
  pendingTasks++;
  processInBackground(req.body)
    .finally(() => pendingTasks--);  // MUST use .finally(), not .then()
  res.status(202).send();
});
```

Always decrement with `.finally()`, not `.then()` alone; rejected promises skip `.then()` and the count never decrements.

### SQLite `createMany` Variable Limit and Webhook Timestamp Validation

**SQLite `createMany` variable limit:** SQLite limits bind parameters per statement (~999 for older builds, up to 32766 in recent ones). Prisma's `createMany` maps each field of each record to a bind variable; for large arrays this can silently fail or throw. Chunk `createMany` calls for tables with more than a handful of fields:

```js
const CHUNK_SIZE = 100;
for (let i = 0; i < records.length; i += CHUNK_SIZE) {
  await prisma.someTable.createMany({ data: records.slice(i, i + CHUNK_SIZE) });
}
```

**Timestamp Date validation before Prisma insert:** Converting webhook numeric timestamps with `new Date(Number(raw.ts) * 1000)` produces `Invalid Date` when the value is non-numeric, null, or NaN. Prisma/LibSQL crashes on `Invalid Date` being inserted into a DateTime column. Always validate after construction:

```js
let startTime = new Date(Number(raw.startTimeInSeconds) * 1000);
if (Number.isNaN(startTime.getTime())) {
  startTime = new Date(); // fallback to current time
}
```

### PrismaClient Global Singleton in Next.js

Next.js can re-evaluate modules multiple times: during development hot reload and in production when bundler chunks each re-evaluate their imports. Each re-evaluation creates a new `PrismaClient` instance, exhausting DB connection pools and causing `Too many connections` or `Connection timeout` errors.

**Fix:** Always guard PrismaClient instantiation with a global variable:

```ts
declare global {
  var __prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

export const prisma =
  global.__prisma ??
  new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? ["warn", "error"] : ["error"],
  });

global.__prisma = prisma;
```

This is the canonical pattern. `global.__prisma` persists across module re-evaluations; the `??` means only one instance is ever created per process lifetime.

**Pair with startup connection retry in production:**

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  const connectWithRetry = async (retries = 5, delay = 2000) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
      try {
        await prisma.$connect();
        console.log("[db] Prisma connected successfully");
        return;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`[db] Connection failed (attempt ${i + 1}/${retries}):`, (err as Error).message);
        if (i < retries - 1) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
      }
    }
    console.error("[db] All Prisma connection attempts failed. App may be unstable.");
  };
  connectWithRetry();
}
```

**Apply to:** any Next.js app that imports PrismaClient in `src/lib/db.ts` (or equivalent). If you see `warn(prisma-client) There are already 10 instances of Prisma Client actively running` in logs, the singleton is missing.

### `PrismaLibSql` Takes a Config Object, NOT a `@libsql/client` Instance

`PrismaLibSql` from `@prisma/adapter-libsql` expects a **Config object** `{ url, authToken? }`; it does NOT accept a pre-constructed `@libsql/client` instance.

```ts
// CORRECT: Config object
import { PrismaLibSql } from "@prisma/adapter-libsql";
const adapter = new PrismaLibSql({ url, authToken });

// WRONG: @libsql/client instance (causes connection errors)
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
const client = createClient({ url, authToken });
const adapter = new PrismaLibSql(client);  // wrong constructor signature
```

**Why this trips AI agents:** The `@libsql/client` package and `@prisma/adapter-libsql` are often imported together in docs and examples, making the instance-passing form look natural. The error from passing an instance is not always obvious; it may manifest as a connection failure or unexpected adapter state rather than a type error.

## Express API Routes: Null-Check After DB Insert and Full try-catch Audit

### DB Write -> DB Read Can Return Null

In Express routes using `better-sqlite3`, a read immediately after a write in the same handler can return `null` even after the write reports success:

```js
db.prepare('INSERT INTO instances ...').run(instanceKey, ...);
const instance = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM instances WHERE instance_key = ?').get(instanceKey);
// instance can be null (race/rollback edge case)
if (!instance) {
  return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve instance after insert' });
}
res.json({ ok: true, instanceId: instance.id }); // crashes without null check above
```

Without the null guard, `instance.id` throws a TypeError and Express returns a 500 with no diagnostic; the client sees a generic error and the root cause is invisible.

**Fix:** Always null-check DB reads, even when they immediately follow a write.

### try-catch in Every Route Handler

Express 4.x does NOT automatically catch synchronous exceptions thrown inside route handlers; they bubble up as unhandled exceptions, not to the registered error handler. Every route that touches the DB, calls JSON.parse, or formats data needs an explicit try-catch:

```js
router.get('/threads/:threadId/messages', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  try {
    const messages = db.prepare(sql).all(...params);
    res.json({ messages });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('GET /messages error:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal error' });
  }
});
```

**The cascade trigger:** once a single missing null-check or missing try-catch is found, audit ALL routes in the file; the pattern is always systemic (every route was written with the same unchecked assumptions). A partial fix leaves silent 500s in remaining routes.

### Nullable Column Guard: `!== undefined` Instead of `||`

When a DB column can legitimately be stored as `null` (e.g. "no target linked"), using `|| default` silently clobbers stored nulls:

```js
// WRONG: clobbers stored null with the default; "row missing" and "row has null" are indistinguishable
const targetId = settings ? settings.target_instance_id || null : null;

// CORRECT: preserves stored null; only defaults when the row itself is absent
const targetId = (settings && settings.target_instance_id) !== undefined
  ? settings.target_instance_id
  : null;
```

**When it matters:** foreign-key columns, optional config values, and any "unlinked" state where `null` is a valid stored value that must round-trip correctly through the GET response.

## CLI `--model` Alias vs. SDK Model ID

The Claude CLI's `--model` flag takes **short aliases**, not API model IDs:

| CLI alias (correct) | API model ID (wrong for CLI) |
|---|---|
| `sonnet` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `opus` | `claude-opus-4-8` |
| `haiku` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |

Using the API ID string causes the CLI call to fail or be silently ignored:

```bash
# CORRECT
claude --print --model sonnet "your prompt"

# WRONG: an SDK model ID, not a CLI alias
claude --print --model claude-sonnet-4-6 "your prompt"
```

**Why agents get this wrong:** SDK docs use full API model IDs. When an agent generates shell commands invoking `claude`, it copies the API ID format instead of the CLI short-form alias.

**When to check:** any code that calls `claude --model <name>` in a shell script or `execSync`/`spawn` call. Aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) are stable; API IDs are version-suffixed and only valid for the SDK.

## Health Endpoint: Data Pipeline Freshness Gate

A `/health` or `/api/health` endpoint should check not only DB connectivity but whether background sync jobs have recently written. An app that is "up" but serving stale data is silently broken.

**Pattern (Next.js / TypeScript):**

```typescript
const STALE_THRESHOLD_MS = 36 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1.5× expected sync interval

const staleProviders = (
  await Promise.all(
    PROVIDERS.map(async (provider) => {
      const conn = await db.query.connections.findFirst({
        where: (c, { eq }) => eq(c.providerName, provider),
      });
      const stale = !conn?.lastSyncedAt ||
        Date.now() - conn.lastSyncedAt.getTime() > STALE_THRESHOLD_MS;
      return stale ? provider : null;
    })
  )
).filter(Boolean);

if (staleProviders.length > 0) {
  return NextResponse.json({ status: 'degraded', staleProviders }, { status: 503 });
}
```

**Key rules:**
- Run all provider checks via `Promise.all` (parallel, not serial)
- Return **503**, not 200 with a warning body; health checks and load balancers need the status code
- Include provider names in the response for rapid diagnosis
- Threshold = ~1.5x expected sync interval (e.g. 36h for a 24h cron)
- `lastSyncedAt IS NULL` is stale; treat it as "never synced"

### V8 Object Nullification in Batch Processing Functions

V8 does not always garbage-collect large objects that remain in scope until a function returns, even when those objects are no longer accessed. In batch-processing functions that build large aggregation maps (counts by key, duration histograms, parsed rows), explicitly set those objects to `null` after use to reduce peak RSS:

```js
export function buildSummaryFromIterator(sinceId, limit) {
  let appDurations = {};   // use `let`, not `const`
  let fileCounts = {};
  let shellCommands = [];

  for (let evt of iterateEventsSinceId(sinceId, limit)) {
    // ... process evt ...
    evt = null;  // free each row object before the next arrives
  }

  const summary = buildMarkdown(appDurations, fileCounts, shellCommands);

  // Explicitly clear large accumulators before return
  appDurations = null;
  fileCounts = null;
  shellCommands = null;

  return { summary };
}
```

**Two nullification sites:**
1. **Loop-body:** set `evt = null` after processing each row so the row object can be reclaimed before the next row is fetched.
2. **Post-accumulation:** set aggregation maps to `null` before `return`. V8 may keep them alive until the caller's frame unwinds; explicit null breaks that hold.

**When to apply:** any function that processes thousands of rows or builds large hash maps, and where the process is memory-constrained (PM2 `max_memory_restart`, containerized Node.js). Requires `let` declarations, not `const`; see the `const` crash-loop gotcha below, which this pattern will trigger if you get the declaration wrong.

## File-Watcher Feedback Loop: Exclude Files the Service Writes To

Any service that (1) watches a directory with chokidar or a similar inotify-backed watcher AND (2) writes to a file inside that directory must explicitly exclude its own output files from watcher events. Without the exclusion, every write triggers an event, which triggers processing, which writes again: an infinite self-triggering loop that pegs CPU and floods the event log.

**Common write targets that must be excluded:**
- SQLite database files (`.db`, `.db-wal`, `.db-shm`)
- Log files (`.log`)
- Lock / state files (`.json.tmp`, `.lock`)
- Editor swap / backup files (`~` suffix, `.bak`, `.swp`)

**Chokidar pattern:**
```js
const watcher = chokidar.watch(dirs, {
  ignored: (path) => {
    if (path.includes('activity.db')) return true;   // DB + WAL + SHM
    if (path.endsWith('.log'))        return true;
    if (path.endsWith('~') || path.endsWith('.bak')) return true;
    return false;
  },
  ignorePermissionErrors: true,
  // ...
});
```

**Why substring match, not exact path:** SQLite writes three files simultaneously (`x.db`, `x.db-wal`, `x.db-shm`). A substring check on the base name catches all three without enumerating each suffix.

**When to apply:** Any time a new watcher-based collector or processor is added to a service that already has a database or log file inside the watched tree. Audit the `ignored` function first; the exclusion is easy to miss when the feature is "just add a new watched directory."

## `Promise.race` Timeout Wrapper Leaves a Dangling Timer

When implementing a timeout helper with `Promise.race`, the naive form leaves the `setTimeout` running even after the main promise resolves. In Node.js every active timer holds a reference that delays event-loop exit and accumulates as timer-slot garbage in long-running servers.

```js
// BAD: timer fires (and logs) after the main promise already resolved
function withTimeout(promise, ms) {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), ms)),
  ]);
}

// GOOD: capture the ID and clear it in .finally()
function withTimeout(promise, ms) {
  let timeoutId;
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), ms);
  });
  return Promise.race([promise, timeoutPromise]).finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
}
```

**When to apply:** Any `withTimeout` / `withDeadline` helper, webhook background-task runners, or any code that uses `Promise.race` with a timeout side channel. The `.finally` guard is zero-cost on the happy path and prevents phantom timer callbacks in high-throughput services.

**Bonus: check backpressure before heavy work.** If the timeout wrapper is used inside a webhook handler that gates on queue depth, perform the 503 backpressure check BEFORE parsing the body or writing to the DB. Rejecting early avoids wasted parse/storage work when the queue is full.

### Companion: `Promise.race` Does NOT Cancel the Losing Promise; Use a Cooperative Signal

Fixing the dangling timer with `.finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId))` stops the *timer* from leaking, but the *losing promise* itself keeps running. If that promise wraps a `for…of` or `while` loop (common in webhook background-task handlers), the loop continues processing items even after `Promise.race` has already rejected with a timeout error. This wastes CPU and DB connections and can cause corrupted state if the loop writes.

**Fix:** accept a cancellation signal object in the promise factory; check it before each iteration.

```typescript
// WRONG: loop keeps running after timeout even with .finally cleanup
function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T> { ... }

// CORRECT: pass a mutable signal the timeout can flip
function withTimeout<T>(
  promiseFn: (signal: { aborted: boolean }) => Promise<T>,
  ms: number,
): Promise<T> {
  const signal = { aborted: false };
  let timeoutId: NodeJS.Timeout;
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise<T>((_, reject) => {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      signal.aborted = true;          // flip the signal before rejecting
      reject(new Error(`timeout after ${ms}ms`));
    }, ms);
  });
  return Promise.race([promiseFn(signal), timeoutPromise]).finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
}

// Caller: check signal.aborted before each expensive unit of work
await withTimeout(async (signal) => {
  for (const id of eventIds) {
    if (signal.aborted) break;        // cooperative exit on timeout
    const event = await db.findById(id);
    await processEvent(event);
  }
}, 30_000);
```

**Why a plain AbortController isn't used:** `AbortController` requires the inner async ops to accept a `signal` option (e.g. `fetch(..., { signal })`). For DB calls and business logic that don't accept signals natively, a shared mutable object is simpler and works without changing every callsite.

## Defensive JSON Parsing in Batch/Summarization Loops

When a batch or summarization function processes DB rows in a loop and advances a cursor or timestamp **after** the loop, a bare `JSON.parse` call will permanently stall the pipeline if any row contains corrupt or missing JSON.

**The failure mode:**
```js
// BAD: one corrupt row aborts the whole batch and the cursor never advances
export function buildSummary(events) {
  for (const evt of events) {
    const meta = JSON.parse(evt.metadata_json); // throws SyntaxError on corrupt row
    // ... build summary using meta
  }
  // ← cursor/timestamp advance happens here; never reached after throw
}

export function runSummarization(config) {
  setInterval(() => {
    try {
      const events = fetchWindow(lastSummarizeTime);
      buildSummary(events);              // throws → caught below
      lastSummarizeTime = now();         // ← never runs; same window re-fetched every tick
    } catch (err) {
      log.error(err);                    // logs every 60s but does nothing useful
    }
  }, 60_000);
}
```

Net effect: no output file is ever written again; the error repeats every tick until the corrupt row ages out of retention (up to the full retention window).

**Fix: defensive parse helper:**
```js
function parseMetadata(evt) {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(evt.metadata_json) ?? {};
  } catch {
    console.warn(`[summarizer] Skipping malformed metadata_json (source=${evt.source}, type=${evt.event_type})`);
    return {};
  }
}

// All call sites: meta = parseMetadata(evt);
// Existing `meta.field || default` guards already handle the empty-object case.
```

**When to apply:** Any function that:
- Processes DB rows in a loop using `JSON.parse` on a stored column, AND
- advances a cursor, timestamp, or counter AFTER the loop body.

One corrupt row in a DB column can arrive from a crashed writer, a schema migration edge case, or a race. Always guard.

**Companion failure mode: list endpoint 500.** The same bare-parse risk applies to consumer GET routes (list/all/feed endpoints) that call `JSON.parse` inside a `.map()` callback on stored blob columns. One corrupt row throws a `SyntaxError` that propagates out of `.map()` and 500s the **entire response**; all healthy sibling rows are lost and the consumer feed goes dark. Degrading the bad row to a fallback while returning healthy siblings is always the better failure mode.

Fix: a `safeJsonParse(raw, fallback, context)` helper that returns a fallback (`null`, `[]`, `{}`) on bad input and logs the failure with row context. Apply anywhere a list endpoint reads a JSON blob column from SQLite.

## SQLite `busy_timeout` Alongside WAL Mode

WAL (`journal_mode = WAL`) reduces write-write contention in SQLite, but does not prevent `SQLITE_BUSY` errors when concurrent API requests hit a read-write boundary. Without a `busy_timeout`, the first concurrent access that finds the DB busy returns an immediate error (better-sqlite3 throws synchronously), which bubbles up as a 500 to the API caller.

**Fix: add `busy_timeout` to the initialization pragma block:**
```js
function initDb() {
  db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
  db.pragma('synchronous = NORMAL');
  db.pragma('foreign_keys = ON');
  db.pragma('busy_timeout = 5000');  // wait up to 5s instead of throwing immediately
  // ...
}
```

**Why 5000ms:** High enough to survive transient request bursts without indefinitely blocking callers. If a write holds the lock for longer than 5s the service has deeper problems.

**When to apply:** Any `better-sqlite3` Express/Node.js server that serves more than one concurrent request. The symptom is sporadic 500 errors under load with no obvious error in the handler; only visible in the DB layer logs as `SQLITE_BUSY`.

## PrismaClient + LibSQL Adapter: Don't Pass `datasourceUrl` in the Constructor

When using `PrismaLibSql` as the Prisma adapter, the adapter already owns the database connection. Passing `datasourceUrl` as an additional constructor option to `PrismaClient` conflicts with the adapter's connection state and causes errors.

```ts
// WRONG: datasourceUrl conflicts with the adapter
const adapter = new PrismaLibSql({ url });
return new PrismaClient({ adapter, datasourceUrl: url });

// CORRECT: adapter handles the connection; PrismaClient needs only the adapter
const adapter = new PrismaLibSql({ url });
return new PrismaClient({ adapter });
```

**Related:** `PrismaLibSql` itself expects a **Config object** `{ url, authToken? }`, not a pre-constructed `@libsql/client` instance (documented above). These are two separate gotchas that can compound: wrong constructor argument to the adapter AND redundant datasourceUrl to PrismaClient.

## Bash Monitoring Scripts: Alert-Once-Then-Suppress via Marker State

**The problem:** A cron monitoring script that uses a file marker to track failure presence (just `touch $FAIL_MARKER`) will re-post a high-priority ping on every subsequent cron cycle during a persistent failure, creating alert spam.

**The fix:** The marker must encode *whether an alert was already sent*, not just that a failure occurred. Use a two-state protocol:

```bash
if [ -f "$FAIL_MARKER" ]; then
  if [ "$(cat "$FAIL_MARKER" 2>/dev/null)" != "alerted" ]; then
    # Second consecutive failure: alert once and suppress further pings
    post_alert "Service still failing after restart" "ping"
    echo "alerted" > "$FAIL_MARKER"
    # else: already alerted, skip (persistent failure suppressed)
  fi
else
  # First failure: grace period, just mark it
  touch "$FAIL_MARKER"
fi

# On recovery, clear the marker so the next failure cycle resets
rm -f "$FAIL_MARKER"
```

**Why three states?** First failure (marker absent) = transient blip grace period, no alert. Second failure (marker empty) = escalate once. Subsequent failures (marker contains "alerted") = suppress. Recovery (service healthy) = rm marker.

**When to apply:** Any bash cron script that sends an alert to your notification channel on failure and uses a marker file to track state. Without this, a service that stays broken for hours generates hundreds of high-priority pings.

## External API 429 Handling: Exponential Backoff + Inter-Request Throttle

When calling an external REST API in a sequential loop (paginating results, fetching per-entity data), two defenses are needed:

**1. Inter-request throttle delay:** Add a fixed sleep between consecutive requests to avoid saturating rate limits before they trigger:
```js
const sleep = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

// In a fetch loop:
for (const item of items) {
  await sleep(200); // 200ms between requests prevents burst triggering 429
  const res = await fetchItem(item.id);
}
```

**2. Exponential backoff on 429:** When a 429 response arrives, back off with jitter and retry:
```js
async function apiFetch(path, options, retryCount = 0) {
  const res = await rawFetch(path, options);

  if (res.status === 429 && retryCount < 5) {
    const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000 + Math.random() * 1000;
    console.warn(`Rate limited on ${path}. Retrying in ${Math.round(delay)}ms (attempt ${retryCount + 1})`);
    await sleep(delay);
    return apiFetch(path, options, retryCount + 1);
  }

  return res;
}
```

The `+ Math.random() * 1000` jitter prevents thundering-herd retries when multiple parallel workers all hit the limit simultaneously.

**When to apply:** Any code that calls a third-party API in a loop. The inter-request sleep prevents rate-limit hits proactively; the 429 backoff handles them reactively when limits vary by tier or time-of-day.

## Express: `URLSearchParams(req.query)` Doesn't Handle Repeated Query Params

`new URLSearchParams(req.query)` appears correct but fails when a query parameter appears more than once in the URL (e.g. `?foo=a&foo=b`). Express parses repeated params as an **array** (`req.query.foo === ['a', 'b']`), but `URLSearchParams` receives a plain object and coerces arrays to a string (`foo=a,b`) instead of two separate entries.

**Fix:** Iterate explicitly and call `.append()` for each value:
```js
// WRONG: loses multiple values for the same key
const params = new URLSearchParams(req.query);

// CORRECT: handles both scalar and array values
const params = new URLSearchParams();
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(req.query)) {
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    value.forEach(v => params.append(key, v));
  } else {
    params.append(key, value);
  }
}
```

**When it matters:** Any Express route that builds a URL from `req.query` to forward to a downstream service (OAuth callbacks, search proxies, redirect handlers). A missing value here can silently break the OAuth state parameter, causing auth failures that are hard to trace.

## OAuth Bootstrap: Copied Token Gets Revoked on Source Rotation

When bootstrapping a service's auth by **copying a token from another instance**, the target is now sharing the source's OAuth refresh token. When the source rotates (via its nightly relogin cron or any auth refresh), the old token value is invalidated and the target immediately 401s ("Invalid authentication credentials").

**The bootstrap is a stopgap only.** Immediately after bootstrapping, give the target its own independent login, then verify its health endpoint reports auth OK again. Once the target has its own token, it self-refreshes normally like every other sibling and survives future source rotations.

**Environment-sourcing gotcha in the cron entry:**
- `. $HOME/.env && cmd` sources variables but does NOT export them; downstream scripts that reference them as env vars get an empty value.
- `set -a; . $HOME/.env; set +a; cmd` forces all sourced variables to be automatically exported, so they are visible to child processes.

## SQLite UPSERT with Optional Columns: Branch by Presence to Avoid Null Overwrite

When a PATCH-style endpoint has optional fields, a single SQLite `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET` that lists all columns will overwrite existing values with `null` whenever those fields are absent from the request body.

**The problem:** `target_instance_id = excluded.target_instance_id` in an UPSERT means "set to whatever was passed in." If the client omits `instanceId`, the bound value is `null`, and the UPSERT silently clears the stored value.

**The fix:** Branch on whether the optional field was provided, and use a separate prepared statement for each case:

```js
if (instanceId !== undefined) {
  // Full UPSERT: includes target_instance_id
  db.prepare(`
    INSERT INTO thread_settings (thread_id, user_id, mode, target_instance_id, updated_at)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
    ON CONFLICT(thread_id, user_id) DO UPDATE SET
      mode = COALESCE(excluded.mode, thread_settings.mode),
      target_instance_id = excluded.target_instance_id,
      updated_at = excluded.updated_at
  `).run(threadId, userId, mode, instanceId || null);
} else {
  // Reduced UPSERT: leaves target_instance_id untouched
  db.prepare(`
    INSERT INTO thread_settings (thread_id, user_id, mode, updated_at)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
    ON CONFLICT(thread_id, user_id) DO UPDATE SET
      mode = COALESCE(excluded.mode, thread_settings.mode),
      updated_at = excluded.updated_at
  `).run(threadId, userId, mode);
}
```

**Why COALESCE isn't enough:** `COALESCE(excluded.col, table.col)` works for non-null fallback, but the column still appears in the UPDATE SET list; if you want to leave it completely untouched when absent from the payload, you must omit it from the query.

**When to apply:** Any SQLite UPSERT backing a PATCH endpoint where some columns are optional. Check for `= excluded.<col>` assignments in UPDATE SET clauses; each one is a potential silent null overwrite.

## SQLite Corruption Auto-Detect and Restore

**Run `PRAGMA quick_check` at startup and auto-restore from backup when corruption is detected.** SQLite corruption can occur from power loss, OOM kills mid-write, or disk I/O errors. Without a startup check the app silently serves stale or incorrect data. The pattern:

```typescript
// In getDb(): before enabling WAL mode or running migrations:
const db = new Database(dbPath);
const result = db.pragma("quick_check") as { quick_check: string }[];
if (!(result.length === 1 && result[0].quick_check === "ok")) {
  db.close();
  // 1. Find latest valid backup: iterate backups/ newest-first, open each readonly, run quick_check
  // 2. Rename corrupted db to <name>.corrupted.<timestamp> (preserved for investigation)
  // 3. Remove WAL/SHM sidecar files from the corrupted DB path
  // 4. Copy backup to the DB path
  // 5. Reopen and verify the restored DB passes quick_check
  // 6. Alert your notification channel: do NOT silently swallow the event
  const restored = restoreFromBackup(dbPath);
  db = new Database(dbPath);
}
db.pragma("journal_mode = WAL");
```

**Companion: proactive cron between restarts.** `getDb()` only runs on process start; corruption that occurs mid-run is undetected until the next restart. Add a standalone integrity-check cron script (e.g. `scripts/check-db-integrity.js`, every 30 min) that opens the DB, runs `PRAGMA quick_check`, restores from backup if needed, and restarts the process (`pm2 restart <name>`) so the app reconnects to the clean file.

**Key implementation details:**
- Iterate backups newest-first and open each readonly before trusting it; a backup may itself be corrupted.
- Remove `.db-wal` and `.db-shm` sidecar files from the corrupted path before copying the backup, or SQLite may try to replay a stale WAL on top of the fresh backup.
- Always send an alert to your notification channel (not just a log line) on both detected corruption and restore failure; this is a production data-loss event.
- `checkDbHealth()` should also call `quick_check` so the `/api/health` endpoint reflects DB integrity, not just app liveness.

**When to apply:** Any `better-sqlite3` or `sqlite3` app with an existing backup cron (daily `.backup` command is the standard). The check adds <5ms to cold start.

## Multi-Pass AI Content Generation: Editor Commentary Placement

When a pipeline uses a refinement/editing pass (a second LLM call that reviews and improves the initial output), the editor model defaults to starting its response with meta-commentary about what it changed: "I noticed the price was missing, so I added it..." This pushes the actual content (the TLDR, the recommendations) below the fold, which creates a poor UX.

**Fix:** Add an explicit instruction to the refinement prompt:

```
IMPORTANT: If you include any editor notes about what was changed, updated, or verified,
place them at the BOTTOM of the output after the Sources section (e.g., under a "---"
divider with a heading like "Editor Notes"). NEVER put change notes, commentary, or
preamble before the content. The first thing in your response must be the content
itself, starting with the TLDR / top-line summary.
```

**Why it needs to be explicit:** Without this instruction the model's default is to "show its work" by leading with a reasoning preamble. The model treats the refinement task as a review task, not a pass-through task, and naturally opens with observations before restating the content.

**Scope:** Applies to any pipeline where a second LLM call edits, expands, or annotates the output of a first call and the result is shown directly to a user.

## Webhook Queue: Array-Based Queue Over Promise Chains

When a server handler receives bursty events (webhooks, sensor streams, message queues) and must process them sequentially with I/O work (DB writes, API calls), avoid the "growing promise chain" anti-pattern:

```js
// ANTI-PATTERN: unbounded heap growth
let queue = Promise.resolve();
queue = queue.then(async () => { /* process event */ });
```

Under sustained high-volume traffic, each `.then()` link retains closure references to the event payload, request ID, and intermediate state; the chain grows indefinitely, causing slow heap exhaustion over hours to days.

**Use an explicit array-based queue with a single-instance processor:**

```js
const queue = [];         // functions, not promises: lightweight
let isProcessing = false;

async function processQueue() {
  if (isProcessing) return;    // prevent re-entrancy
  isProcessing = true;
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const task = queue.shift(); // shift() lets GC reclaim immediately
    try { await task(); } catch (e) { console.error('queue task failed', e); }
    // error in one task does NOT stop remaining tasks
  }
  isProcessing = false;
}

// Enqueue from the request handler (fire-and-forget):
queue.push(async () => { /* process webhook body */ });
processQueue();  // idempotent: no-op if already draining
```

**Key properties:**
- Tasks are stored as functions (cheap), not pending promises (retain scope until GC)
- `shift()` lets the GC reclaim each completed task immediately
- `isProcessing` flag prevents concurrent drain starts; at most one drain loop active
- Per-task try/catch: one failure doesn't break the rest of the queue

**Also guard nullable items in event payloads** before property access; external services sometimes send null entries in array fields:

```js
for (const sample of samples) {
  if (!sample || typeof sample !== 'object') continue; // null guard
  if (sample.heartRate) { /* safe to access */ }
}
```

**Refinement for large payloads: queue IDs, not bodies.** When webhook payloads are large (batch dumps, sensor summaries), even the array-based queue can OOM because function closures still capture the full payload. Pattern: persist the raw event to the DB first, queue only the returned ID, then fetch from DB one-by-one during background drain:

```js
// Phase 1: request handler: sync DB write, return IDs to caller
const [eventId] = await storeRawEvent(payload);  // returns array of IDs
res.json({ stored: 1 });

// Enqueue only the ID (not the body):
queue.push(eventId);
processQueue();

// Phase 2: drain loop re-fetches from DB per event:
async function processQueue() {
  if (isProcessing) return;
  isProcessing = true;
  try {
    while (queue.length > 0) {
      const id = queue.shift();
      const event = await db.webhookEvent.findUnique({ where: { id } });
      if (!event || event.processed) continue;
      try { await handleEvent(event); }
      catch (e) { console.error('webhook event failed', id, e); }
      await db.webhookEvent.update({ where: { id }, data: { processed: true } });
    }
  } finally {
    isProcessing = false;   // always reset, even if an error escapes the loop
  }
}
```

**Why `try...finally` on the while loop:** Per-task try/catch handles expected errors, but an unhandled rejection escaping the loop leaves `isProcessing = true` permanently, blocking all future processing. The `finally` guarantees reset regardless of how the loop exits.

## Multi-Phase AI Research Pipeline with Disqualification Gates

When building an AI agent that researches and recommends (restaurants, vendors, candidates), structure the prompt as sequential phases that narrow candidates and deepen verification, rather than one long monolithic research pass.

**Phase 1: Initial Shortlist:** Broad search across sources. Output: ranked list of N candidates.

**Phase 2: Deep Review (highest value):** For each shortlisted candidate, extract **verbatim quotes** (2-4 per source). Do NOT paraphrase; exact quotes are the trust signal. Apply explicit **Disqualification Triggers**:
- Declining quality trend (reviews mentioning "used to be good")
- Hygiene or service red flags in recent reviews
- Rating trend reversal in last 6 months
- Hard criteria mismatch (permanently closed, no matching offering, out of price range)

Output two sections: **What people are saying** (quoted snippets with attribution) and **Disqualified** (removed candidates with reason). Transparency in rejection demonstrates the agent applied real judgment; it is UX-critical, not optional.

**Phase 3: Specialty Verification:** For each surviving candidate, answer the specific expertise question (signature offerings, pricing, key differentiators) by consulting official sites or authoritative sources.

**Implementation notes:**
- Increase the LLM timeout for each additional phase; each substantive phase adds 3-5 minutes, so set timeout to `(N_phases × 5 min) + buffer`
- Verbatim quote extraction is non-negotiable: paraphrasing erodes trust; exact quotes build it
- Disqualification criteria must be **explicit and checkable**, not vague sentiment
- Disqualification is UX-critical: it shows verification was real, not just a shortlist

**When to apply:** Any structured research task with candidate evaluation. Not needed for simple single-answer lookups.

## `for…of` Loop: Don't Assign to `const` Loop Variable (Crash Loop Gotcha)

Trying to reassign a `for…of` loop variable declared with `const` (or from destructuring with `const`) throws `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable` and crashes the loop, turning the crash into a crash loop if the process manager auto-restarts:

```javascript
// WRONG: crashes every iteration
for (const evt of db.prepare('SELECT * FROM events').iterate()) {
  process(evt);
  evt = null; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
}
```

**Fix:** Use `let`. Also: nulling a loop variable to "help GC" is cargo-cult code in this position; modern JS releases the reference when the block exits. Drop the null assignment unless you have measured a real RSS problem (see the V8 nullification section above, which requires `let`).

```javascript
// CORRECT
for (const evt of db.prepare('SELECT * FROM events').iterate()) {
  process(evt);
}
```

**Destructured variables from function returns are also `const` by default:**

```javascript
// WRONG: lastId is const, can't be updated in a loop
const { summary, lastId, count } = buildSummaryFromIterator(sinceId, MAX);
// … later trying to re-use lastId fails at assignment
```

Use `let` for any variable you intend to update after the initial binding.

**Same applies to function-scope `const` null-for-GC patterns.** After a function body finishes, "help GC" null assignments on `const`-declared accumulators throw the same error:
```javascript
// WRONG: cargo-cult GC hint on const variables crashes the function
const appDurations = {};
const fileCounts   = {};
// ... populate them ...
appDurations = null; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
fileCounts   = null;
```
**Fix:** Remove the null assignments, or declare with `let`.

### Slug Guard: Always Return `[]` on Empty Derived Slug

When converting a string to a slug for use as a URL path segment, guard against returning an empty string. A slug-generation function that strips all non-alphanumeric characters from an empty or special-character-only input (e.g. `""`, `"!!!"`, `"   "`) produces `""`, which, if not caught, gets used as a URL path segment and probes a root endpoint. Root endpoints usually return HTTP 200, causing a false-positive "found" match.

```javascript
// WRONG: empty/whitespace input returns [''] which probes root URLs
function slugify(name) {
  const clean = name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '').trim();
  return [clean.replace(/\s+/g, '-')]; // returns [''] if clean is ''
}

// CORRECT: guard immediately after cleaning
function slugify(name) {
  const clean = name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '').trim();
  if (!clean) return []; // never use a blank slug as a URL path segment
  return [clean.replace(/\s+/g, '-')];
}
```

This applies to any pattern where a derived identifier is used to construct a URL (org slugs, API names, subdomain components). Related: after any slugify/normalize call that feeds a lookup or comparison, filter out empty strings, since `includes('')` is always true and an empty slug matches every candidate.

### Shell Script Network Calls: Always Set Timeouts on `curl` and `ssh`

Unattended shell scripts (cron jobs, process-manager start scripts, push-metrics workers) that call `curl` or `ssh` without timeouts will hang indefinitely if the remote host is slow or unreachable. This stalls the managed process, blocks the flock, and causes the next cron tick to queue behind it.

**curl:** always pass `--max-time <seconds>` (total) and `--connect-timeout <seconds>` (TCP handshake only):

```bash
curl --max-time 10 --connect-timeout 5 -s "https://api.example.com/data"
```

**ssh:** always pass `ConnectTimeout` and `ServerAliveInterval` (detect dead connections mid-transfer):

```bash
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2 user@host "command"
```

Without these, a single hung SSH or curl stalls the whole process indefinitely; no alert fires, and the cron is silently blocked until the process is killed manually.

## Client-Side Storage Schema Validation

### `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`: Validate Schema on Load

`JSON.parse()` succeeds on structurally-valid JSON that violates the current app schema: an older object missing required fields, a manually-edited value, or a truncated write. Reading undefined properties on the result throws silently downstream or crashes components.

**Pattern:** Always normalize parsed client-side storage data back to the known-good schema:

```ts
function normalizeState(raw: unknown): AppState {
  const defaults = getDefaultState();
  if (!raw || typeof raw !== 'object') return defaults;
  const parsed = raw as Partial<AppState>;
  return {
    phase: parsed.phase ?? defaults.phase,
    items: Array.isArray(parsed.items) ? parsed.items : defaults.items,
    // ...all required fields with explicit defaults
  };
}

function loadState(): AppState {
  try {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
    return stored ? normalizeState(JSON.parse(stored)) : getDefaultState();
  } catch {
    return getDefaultState();
  }
}
```

**Why `try/catch` alone is not enough:** `JSON.parse` throws only on invalid JSON syntax. A well-formed but schema-mismatched object (e.g. `{phase: "done"}` when the current schema requires `{phase: "done", categories: [...]}`) parses without error and passes silently until a component reads `state.categories.length` and crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined".

## Required-Field Validation in User-Authored Config/YAML Parsers

When parsing user-authored YAML, JSON, or dict-based config files, never access required keys via raw dict indexing (`d["type"]` -> cryptic `KeyError: 'type'`). Use a helper that raises a descriptive error naming both the missing field and its location in the document.

```python
def _require(d: dict, key: str, context: str):
    if key not in d:
        raise ValueError(f"{context} is missing required '{key}' field.")
    return d[key]

# Usage:
entity_type = _require(entity, "type", f"Scenario entity #{i+1}")
entity_id   = _require(entity, "id",   f"Scenario entity #{i+1}")
```

Without this: a YAML file missing `type` crashes with `KeyError: 'type'` that names neither the entity index nor the document location. The user must trace the stack through the parser.

With `_require`: the crash becomes `ValueError: Scenario entity #3 is missing required 'type' field.`, which is actionable, testable, and needs no internal trace.

**When this applies:** Any parser that reads user-authored config/YAML where field absence is a user error (not a code bug). All required fields should be validated via context-aware helpers, not trusted to raise `KeyError` through raw indexing.

## Autonomous Agent Repos: Gitignore Runtime State Files

In repos where a cron loop runs an agent CLI to create agent branches, any file that the RUNNER writes and the AGENT also touches via git will cause **branch-snowball drift**:

1. Agent creates branch `claude/task-N` from `main`.
2. Runner writes to a tracked runtime state file (dedup JSON, cron log, outcome JSONL).
3. That file drifts on the branch.
4. Next agent run branches off the drifted branch instead of `main` (the runner reads `HEAD`, which is still on the branch after a stale checkout).
5. The snowball accumulates: 14+ commits pile up on a branch that was supposed to stay small.

**Fix:** Gitignore all runtime state written by the autonomous loop itself. Keep only config and intentional human-authored history.

Files to gitignore in an autonomous agent repo:
- Dedup/error-handler state JSON (`*.error-handler-state.json`, `reviewer-state.json`)
- Cron and run logs (`logs/*.log`, `logs/run-*.log`)
- Output data streams (`.outcomes.jsonl`, `*-comparison.jsonl`)
- Automated reports/scores generated each cycle (`supervisor/reports/`, `supervisor/scores/`)
- Runtime lock files (`.running.lock`, `state.json`)

**What to keep tracked:** `config.json` (real config), `logs/progress.md` or similar intentional session journals that agents deliberately commit.

## Gemini CLI Free-Tier Deprecation: Verify Before Depending On It

The Gemini CLI's free **Gemini Code Assist for individuals** tier (`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_GCA=true`) was deprecated in June 2026. Any invocation now fails immediately with:

```
IneligibleTierError: This client is no longer supported for Gemini Code Assist
for individuals. ... migrate to the Antigravity suite
```

This is **account-level and pre-request**; it fires before the model is even reached. Flags like `--skip-trust`, `--model`, or changing the working directory do not help.

**Ecosystem impact:** every cron script or managed service that runs `gemini -p "..."` silently exits non-zero. Because cron scripts often suppress stderr or only log to the process manager, these failures may go unnoticed for days.

**How to detect:** run `gemini -p "hello"` in the relevant shell. If it errors in `_doSetupUser`, the tier is gone.

**When it happens:**
1. Audit every scheduled job that calls `gemini` (`grep -rn "gemini -p" <repo>`).
2. Disable or comment out the Gemini paths and fall back to another CLI you have working auth for.
3. Migration path: the vendor's current suite or a paid `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**General lesson:** a free vendor tier is a dependency with no SLA. Any scheduled job built on one needs a detectable failure mode and a documented fallback.

## Codex CLI Gotchas

### Keep the CLI up-to-date: stale versions silently break all models

The Codex CLI can fall far behind the backend and produce 400 errors for every model:

```
Error: 400 "The '<model>' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account"
```

This happens even for the default model and even after re-login. The fix is **not** re-authentication; it is updating the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
```

Root cause: a stale client sends model IDs the backend no longer accepts. After updating, both text and vision calls succeed.

**Apply:** when `codex exec` returns 400 for all models, update first before debugging auth or model selection.

### Vision `-i` flag is variadic: pass prompt via stdin

The `-i` (image) flag on `codex exec` accepts multiple values (variadic). Providing the prompt as a positional argument after images causes it to be consumed as an additional image path:

```bash
# WRONG: "Describe the store logo" is treated as an image path
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -i receipt.jpg "Describe the store logo"

# RIGHT: pipe the prompt via stdin; -i takes only image paths
echo "Describe the store logo" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -i receipt.jpg
```

**Apply:** any time you use `-i`, deliver the prompt text via stdin (not positional).

### Testing gotcha: `codex exec` echoes the prompt in output

`codex exec` echoes your input prompt in the response before the model's answer. Grepping the raw output for a keyword you also used in the prompt produces false positives:

```bash
# WRONG: finds the echoed prompt, not the model's answer
echo "Reply with OK if this works" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check | grep "OK"

# RIGHT: read the full output or strip the first line
echo "Reply with OK if this works" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check
```

**Apply:** when scripting CLI calls, inspect the full output rather than grepping for a word that also appears in the prompt.

## Windows Wake Timers Require Sleep, Not Shutdown

Windows Task Scheduler's `WakeToRun` flag can pull the host out of **S3 (sleep) or S4 (hibernate)**. It does **NOT** work when the host is fully **powered off (S5/shutdown)**.

**Symptom:** Overnight scheduled jobs don't run: no logs, no errors, no evidence the machine was ever woken. The task is configured correctly but the machine was shut down instead of sleeping.

**Why:** Wake timers rely on standby power maintained during S3/S4. A full S5 shutdown cuts this power; the firmware has nothing to trigger on.

**Fix:** Before an overnight run, put the machine to sleep instead of shutting down. From WSL:

```bash
# Trigger Windows sleep from WSL (no password prompt)
/mnt/c/Windows/System32/rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0
```

**S4 (hibernate) also works** but is slower to wake (~30s vs ~5s from S3). Avoid S5 entirely when scheduled overnight jobs are active.

## Custom Skill Source-of-Truth: Repo Before Live Copy

When your skills live in a repo and are deployed into the agent's live skills directory, the repo is the source of truth. The intended sync direction is: **edit in repo -> copy to live**.

**Never edit the live skills directory directly.** If you improve a skill in-session (add a step, fix a gotcha, update a command), edit the repo copy instead, then copy the updated file to the live path. Commit and push.

**If you discover drift** (live copy is ahead of the repo), reconcile immediately: diff the two files, apply the improvements to the repo file, commit, and push. Don't close the session with the repo behind.

**Why this matters:** Any remote host that syncs skills from the repo will silently overwrite a live-copy improvement that was never committed, and that improvement will never reach remotely-dispatched jobs.

## Cron PATH Double Trap: agent CLI + node

Cron jobs run with a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin`). Scripts that invoke a globally-installed Node CLI face a two-layer PATH failure that's easy to miss:

1. `/usr/local/bin/<cli>` is not on PATH -> `<cli>: command not found` (exit 127)
2. The CLI is a **Node.js script** (`#!/usr/bin/env node`), so even after fixing the CLI path, cron also lacks `/usr/local/bin/node` -> `env: node: No such file or directory` (exit 127) before any auth or business logic runs.

Both failures are silently swallowed if the cron wrapper treats exit 127 as "transient" and doesn't alert. The script runs dead indefinitely.

**Fix:** Prepend both bin dirs at the top of any cron-invoked script:
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"
```

Or pin explicitly:
```bash
CLAUDE_BIN="${CLAUDE_BIN:-$(command -v claude 2>/dev/null || echo /usr/local/bin/claude)}"
```

**Validate before deploying as cron:** test the script under cron's minimal environment:
```bash
env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=$HOME bash your-script.sh
```

**Real impact:** an auth keep-alive probe ran blind for 10+ days because cron lacked node; the OAuth refresh token expired undetected with no alert.

## Per-Item Failure Isolation in Batch Loops

When a loop processes a batch (DB rows, files, API records) and each iteration performs an operation that can throw on bad data, an unguarded throw aborts the **entire** batch, not just the bad item. A second failure: if the cursor or timestamp advance happens **after** the loop, the same failing window is re-processed every tick forever.

**Two-layer defense:**

1. **Guard the throwing operation itself.** Wrap any expression that can fail on stored/external data:
   - `new RegExp(storedPattern)` -> wrap in a helper that returns `null` on `SyntaxError`
   - `JSON.parse(externalData)` -> wrap in `try/catch`, return a safe default
   - Division by a data-derived value -> check divisor `!== 0` first

2. **Wrap each loop iteration in `try/catch + continue`** so one bad record is skipped, not fatal:
   ```js
   for (const item of items) {
     try {
       processItem(item);
     } catch (err) {
       console.warn(`[batch] Skipping item ${item.id}: ${err.message}`);
     }
   }
   ```

**Self-review trigger:** Any `new RegExp(nonLiteral)`, `JSON.parse(fileOrNetwork)`, or division by a data-sourced value inside a loop; ask: "does one bad input abort the whole batch?"

**Bonus:** Compile invariant regexes **once before** the loop, not per-iteration, to avoid repeated throws and wasted compile time.

**Real impact:** a feature that called `new RegExp(storedPattern)` at three sites with no guard. One malformed stored pattern threw `SyntaxError` and 500'd the endpoint for every one of the user's records.

## PM2 Stop Is Not Durable Against Deploy-Path Restarts

`pm2 stop <app>` + `pm2 save` does NOT permanently stop an app. If the app has its own deploy script (or any automation path) that calls `pm2 restart`, `pm2 startOrRestart`, or `pm2 start`, the app will come back online after the next deploy, overriding the saved stopped state.

This recurs on memory-constrained hosts: services stopped and saved months earlier are found fully online later, because their deploy paths call `pm2 startOrRestart`.

**Solutions:**

- **`pm2 delete` + remove from ecosystem config**: only viable for apps with no active deploy path. Permanent removal, not just a stop.

- **On-demand waker pattern**: for low-traffic apps that need to stay launchable but shouldn't run 24/7, put a proxy in front of the app's process. The waker `pm2 start`s the app on the first request, then an idle reaper `pm2 stop`s it after N minutes of no traffic. Crucially, the reaper also re-stops any KEEP_STOPPED apps that were externally revived, making the stopped state durable against deploy-path restarts. Point the reverse proxy's upstream at the waker instead of the app's direct port.

- **Remove the staging start from deploy scripts**: if a "staging" variant keeps coming back, trace the deploy script and remove the `pm2 start <staging-app>` call from it.

**Why it matters:** a host running dozens of always-on PM2 processes on a few GB of RAM has little headroom (each Next.js `next-server` uses 60-170MB). Stopped apps coming back online erode the headroom that batch jobs and remote agent runs depend on.

**Restarting a waker-managed app correctly:** Don't `pm2 start`/`pm2 restart` a waker-managed app directly. The waker tracks `lastSeen` per app; an app started outside the waker has `lastSeen` defaulting to `0`, so the next reaper tick sees it as long-idle and immediately stops it again: a restart that appears to silently fail seconds later for no visible reason. To restart correctly, either make a request through the waker or let it wake from real traffic.

## Cron Script Failure Alerting: EXIT Trap + Shared Alert Helper

Silent failures in unattended cron scripts are the #1 cause of auth expiry going undetected for days. When a cron script can fail without triggering an alert on its usual channel, add an EXIT trap that alerts on non-zero exit.

**Pattern:**
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
alert_email() {
  local subject="$1" body="$2"
  "$SCRIPT_DIR/send-alert-email.sh" "$subject" "$body" 2>/dev/null || true
}

trap 'rc=$?; [[ $rc -ne 0 ]] && alert_email "script-name failed (exit $rc)" "$(tail -5 "$LOG_FILE" 2>/dev/null)"' EXIT
```

**Rules:**
- The alert helper should read its credentials from a secrets file and **exit 0 even on send failure**, so alerting never breaks the caller or changes the cron's exit code.
- Use an `EXIT` trap (not `ERR`) so the alert fires on any non-zero exit, including `set -e` aborts mid-script.
- For failure modes that produce exit 0 but didn't actually complete (e.g. an account mismatch after OAuth rotation), also alert inline with a direct call; the EXIT trap alone won't catch these.

**Where to apply:** Any unattended cron script doing auth rotation, credential refresh, or other critical actions where silent failure causes downstream outages.

**Refinement: suppress the high-priority channel for known-benign recurring failures.** Not every non-zero exit deserves an inbox page. If a specific failure mode is diagnosed as recurring, self-healing, and already covered by an independent recovery mechanism, set a local `SUPPRESS_EXIT_EMAIL` flag before that branch and check it in the EXIT trap: post to the low-priority channel as usual (still a useful signal) but skip the page. Keep the suppression scoped to the *specific classified error kind*, not the whole script, so a genuinely new failure mode still pages.

## Suspending an Autonomous Agent: Full Checklist

When permanently suspending an autonomous service, stopping the process manager alone is not enough. Three separate systems keep an agent alive: the process manager (restores on reboot and deploy-path restarts), cron (fires on schedule regardless of process-manager state), and remote copies (the same repo may run on multiple machines with independent process managers and crontabs).

**Checklist (run on EVERY machine that runs the agent):**
- [ ] `pm2 stop <service> && pm2 save`: prevents auto-restart on reboot or deploy
- [ ] Comment out all cron entries for the agent (`# PAUSED YYYY-MM-DD`); a cron that calls `run.sh` directly bypasses the process manager and can restart the agent as a side effect
- [ ] Add `SUSPENDED.md` in the repo root with: date, reason, machine(s) affected, resume instructions
- [ ] Verify journal/channel entries stop within one cron cycle

**Why multi-machine matters:** an agent suspended on the primary workstation kept running on a remote host that had a fully independent installation with its own process manager, crontab, and no SUSPENDED.md. It continued firing its loop every 30 minutes, posting noise for two days after the "suspension".

To suspend on a remote host: SSH in, comment out cron entries with `sed "/service-name/s/^/# PAUSED YYYY-MM-DD /"`, and add SUSPENDED.md to the repo on that machine.

## Auth Keep-Alives and Shared Refresh Tokens

- Resolve the binary up front in cron scripts: `CLAUDE_BIN="${CLAUDE_BIN:-$(command -v claude 2>/dev/null || echo /usr/local/bin/claude)}"` and call `"$CLAUDE_BIN"`. Works under both interactive PATH and bare cron PATH. Prepend both bin dirs: `export PATH="$(dirname "$(command -v node 2>/dev/null || echo /usr/local/bin/node)"):$(dirname "$CLAUDE_BIN"):$PATH"`.
- Prefer auth keep-alives that do NOT depend on the CLI at all: refresh directly via the OAuth `refresh_token` grant (curl + python3).
- The OAuth `refresh_token` grant is rate-limited account-wide: 3+ refreshes in a few minutes can trip a sustained 429 throttle (observed lasting ~2h) that blocks BOTH hosts. Never loop-retry a refresh; space attempts hours apart and let cron self-heal. A fresh interactive login (authorization_code grant) is a separate bucket if you must recover sooner.
- Always pair an auth keep-alive with a probe that alerts on failure, so a silent keep-alive failure surfaces in hours, not days.
- Refresh tokens ROTATE and are single-use: two hosts cannot share one credentials chain (whoever refreshes first breaks the other). Give each host its own device login.

### Parallel Bash calls race on persisted shell cwd: always cd with an absolute path explicitly

When two Bash tool calls are issued in the same message (parallel), the working directory is a single persisted shell state shared across them. If call A does `cd /repo-x && npm run build` and call B (in the same parallel batch) just runs `npm run build` assuming an earlier command's cwd still holds, the two calls can race and B executes in whatever directory A leaves the shell in, producing a false-positive "build passed" read against the WRONG repo. This was caught only because the printed route names didn't match the target repo.

**How to apply:** in every Bash tool call that will run alongside others in a parallel batch, put an explicit `cd <absolute-path> &&` at the start of the command. Never depend on a prior tool call's cd persisting when there are concurrent siblings issued this turn. Applies to any agent doing multi-repo build/test sweeps in parallel.

### Follow-mode log commands piped into head leak a shell process forever

A streaming log command piped into something that exits early leaks a shell process FOREVER. One instance of `pm2 logs <app> --lines 100 2>&1 < /dev/null | head -200` had been running for 41 days. `pm2 logs` follows by default and never exits; `head -200` closes the pipe after 200 lines; pm2 does not die on the resulting SIGPIPE, so the wrapping bash waits on it indefinitely. Two sibling orphans (21 days) and an abandoned agent CLI session (15 days) were reaped in the same sweep.

Rules:

1. **Never run a follow-mode log command from an agent Bash call without disabling follow.** Use `pm2 logs <app> --nostream --lines N`. The same trap applies to `tail -f`, `journalctl -f`, `docker logs -f`, and `kubectl logs -f`: prefer the tool's own non-streaming flag over piping into `head`.

2. **If a non-streaming flag does not exist, bound it externally**: `timeout 10 <cmd> | head -N`. Piping into `head` alone is NOT sufficient, because it relies on the producer handling SIGPIPE.

3. **These leaks are invisible in normal monitoring.** Each orphan held only ~1 MB RSS, so no memory alert ever fired; they were only found by `ps -o pid,etime` during an unrelated audit. Periodically sweep for long-lived `bash -c source .../shell-snapshots/` processes, which are the signature of a leaked agent Bash call.

4. **The `claude` CLI ignores SIGTERM.** Reaping it needs a SIGTERM then SIGKILL escalation; the same reason long-running server wrappers should implement their own SIGTERM -> SIGKILL grace period rather than relying on a spawn `timeout` option.

### A Next.js standalone build in a git worktree nests the server under `.next/standalone/<path-from-repo-root>`

Building a Next.js app with `output: "standalone"` inside a git worktree whose `node_modules` is a symlink to the parent checkout makes Next trace the workspace root to the PARENT repo. The bundle is then emitted at `.next/standalone/<relative-path-of-worktree>/server.js`, not `.next/standalone/server.js`, and `.next/standalone/.next` does not exist.

**Why:** file tracing resolves the monorepo/workspace root through the symlink target, so every path in the bundle is expressed relative to that root.

**How to apply:** when verifying a worktree build locally, locate the entrypoint with `find .next/standalone -name server.js` before copying `.next/static`, `public/` and `.env` next to it; do not assume the flat layout that a deploy script produces in the canonical checkout. The deployed layout is unaffected because a normal checkout has a real `node_modules`.
