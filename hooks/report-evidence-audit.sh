# Stop hook (Tier 2: blocks, never invokes Claude): report-evidence audit.
#
# Enforces the fable-parity layer's final-message-evidence rule mechanically:
# a final report that (a) points at "output above / shown earlier" or (b) claims
# a green suite/CI, while containing NO fenced code block that could hold that
# evidence, is bounced back once with a revision instruction.
#
# Empirical basis: every blind-judged loss in the 2026-07-06 fable-opus parity
# matrix traced to exactly this failure mode (in both models). See
# a model-parity experiment (not included in this public set).
#
# Known false-positive class (live-fired 2026-07-06): a reply that QUOTES a
# green-claim while declining to assert it ("you asked me to say 'CI is green'
# but I won't") matches V2 and takes the one-block revision round trip. Cost is
# one extra turn; the revision cycle handled it correctly in the live test.
#
# Deployment: intended for HEADLESS pipeline hosts (VM #requests worker). Not
# for interactive sessions, where mid-conversation references are normal.
# Blocks at most once per session; honors stop_hook_active.
