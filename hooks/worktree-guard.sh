# worktree-guard.sh — PreToolUse (Edit|Write). Enforces per-session git worktrees at the
# only moment enforcement can still help: the FIRST write to a contested repo.
#
# Why not a Stop hook (asked 2026-08-02): by Stop time the editing already happened in the
# shared checkout, so blocking the stop cannot retroactively isolate anything — there is no
# remediation left, only nagging. Worse, Stop cannot distinguish "correctly skipped a
# worktree" (read-only work, ops, one-file edits, all explicitly exempt in agent.md) from
# "forgot", so it would fire on both and train reflexive acks, which is how a guard stops
# working. Stop already has its correct job here: check-unpushed.sh catches work STRANDED
# in a worktree, i.e. "did your work escape this machine", not "did you use the workflow".
#
# Fires ONLY when all three hold, which is what makes this enforcement and not friction:
#   1. the target file resolves inside a repo under the guarded root, AND
#   2. it is not already inside .claude/worktrees/, AND
#   3. another LIVE session has written THE SAME FILE.
#
# Condition 3 was originally "holds that same repo" and that was wrong. Shipped
# 2026-08-02, and within ~15 minutes it produced two false positives against a real peer
# session (two different repos, with zero overlapping files in both cases), which
# acked both and carried on without taking a worktree -- the reflexive-ack failure this
# guard's own header warns about. Repo-level co-presence is the NORMAL state when several
# sessions run; it is not a collision. Same-file contention is.
#
# What repo-level co-presence actually risks -- a stage-everything commit sweeping a
# peer's uncommitted work -- is already blocked by claim-guard's deny arm, so widening
# this hook back out would add friction without adding protection.
#
# Blocks with exit 2 + stderr (PreToolUse: stdout on exit 0 does not reliably reach the
# model). Escape hatch, because a denial must never be a dead end:
#   printf '%s\t%s\n' '<repo-name>' '<reason>' >> /tmp/claude-claim-ack-<sid>
# Shares that ack file and the audit log with claim-guard.sh so there is one override
# mechanism and one trail, not two.

# Cost of this narrowing, accepted: a peer writing via heredoc or `sed -i` is invisible

WORKTREE GUARD: another LIVE session (${PEER_SID:0:8}, active ${PEER_AGE}m ago) has written THIS EXACT FILE in the shared checkout:
  ${FP_REAL}

Take a worktree first, then redo this edit:
  EnterWorktree            -> creates .claude/worktrees/<name> on its own branch
  ... work, commit ...
  merge to the default branch and push before you stop

Why: one checkout, several sessions. In a worktree a stage-everything commit is safe by
construction instead of merely guarded. See guidance/concurrent-sessions.md.

Deploys read the CANONICAL checkout, so merge and push before deploying from a worktree.

If a worktree is genuinely wrong here (ops work, a one-file edit, read-only), record the
decision and retry:
  printf '%s\t%s\n' '${REPO_NAME}' '<reason>' >> ${ACK}

exit 2
