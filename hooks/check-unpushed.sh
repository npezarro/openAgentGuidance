# "this session has unpushed work". That is false when the session wrote a file and then
# deliberately reverted it -- e.g. it moved its work into a git worktree, or a CONCURRENT
# agent session left its own uncommitted edits on the same path. ~/repos/<app> is one working
# tree that several sessions can edit at once, so "dirty" does not imply "mine".

# each line must name one exact path and carry a reason.
