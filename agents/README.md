# Claude Code Subagent Definitions

Version-controlled copies of the custom subagent definitions that live at `~/.claude/agents/` (the active location Claude Code reads from). These were previously unversioned and live-only; this directory is their backup and source of history.

Each `<name>.md` defines a specialist subagent (frontmatter `name` + `description`, optional `model`, optional `allowed-tools`, then the system prompt). Definitions are self-contained: no external persona or state files.

## Current agents
- **architect**: system design, architecture decisions, migration planning
- **debugger**: bug hunting, error analysis, root cause
- **doc-sync**: CLAUDE.md freshness / documentation drift
- **propagation**: routes learnings to all destinations
- **quick-search**: fast cheap codebase search (Haiku-pinned)
- **reviewer**: code review and security audit
- **security**: threat modeling, auth, secrets hygiene, hardening
- **verifier**: independent skeptic that refutes "it works / fixed / passing" claims before they are reported or merged

## Sync (mirrors the claude-skills pattern)
Edit in this repo, then copy to the active location, commit, and push here for history:

```bash
# repo -> active
cp <this-repo>/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
# active -> repo (capture live edits before committing)
cp ~/.claude/agents/*.md <this-repo>/agents/
```

These are generic role prompts with no secrets, safe for this public repo. See `guidance/when-to-fan-out.md` for when to actually spawn these subagents.
